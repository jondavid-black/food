## What is Git Food?

Git Food is a simple, clean collection of recipes that I've been tracking in cabinets, note cards, or scattered documents for years.  I needed to get things a bit more organized and controlled, and as a Software Engineer I knew I had the tools to do it.  Git Food is an organized collection of recipes, captured in Markdown, and automatically presented online using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.  Enough of the nerdy stuff...use the categories at the top of the page or the links below to find something delicious!
