April found this double layer pumpkin cheesecake recipe a few years ago and made it as a special treat for me. It’s a beautiful marriage of pie royalty…what could be better? If you’re ever coming over and wondering what desert to bring, this is it! Makes 1 pie…serves 1 if I’m around.  May start fights among me and the boys!

## Ingredients
- 2 packages (8 oz each) Philadelphia cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla
- 2 eggs
- ½ cup canned pumpkin
