We started adapting this recipe at our Cajun Christmas party a few years ago...and it has been back by request frequently.  This recipe originated with Emeril Lagasse and has been tweaked a bit.  I always make a huge batch because the boys love the leftovers, so you may want to halve the portions. This is not a very spicy dish, but you can use hot smoked sausage or keep some hot sauce handy if you like it with a kick.


## Ingredients
- 2 lb dried red beans, rinsed and sorted over
- 1 package hickory smoked bacon
- 1 lb hickory smoked ham, diced
- 4 medium white onions, chopped
- 6 stalks celery, sliced thin
- 4 green bell peppers, chopped
- Fresh ground black pepper
- Kosher salt
- Dash cayenne
- 3 bay leaves
- Â½ cup fresh chopped parsley
- 3/4 package fresh thyme
- 2 lb smoked sausage
- 6 cloves chopped garlic
- 4 32oz boxes of chicken broth
- 4 cups white rice
- Green onions, chopped


## Instructions
1. Sort, clean and soak the red beans in water overnight.
1. Grill smoked sausage until lightly charred.  Halve and slice the sausages.
1. Chop the bacon into small strips and place into a large pot over medium heat.
1. Once rendered, add onions, celery, and bell peppers.  Cook 5-10 minutes.
1. Add garlic, bay leaves, thyme, salt, pepper, cayenne, ham, and sausage.  Cook until vegetables are soft, stirring regularly.
1. Add soaked beans and enough broth to cover everything in the pot.
1. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.  Cook uncovered for 2 hours stirring every 15 minutes.  Add broth as needed to prevent from drying out and scorching.
1. Crush red beans between spoons to create a gravy of the desired thickness and cook an additional 30 minutes.
1. Remove bay leaves and any thyme sprigs.  Serve over rice and garnish with chopped green onions.
