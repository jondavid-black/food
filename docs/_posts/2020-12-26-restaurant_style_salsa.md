Originally taken from the food network, we have managed to adjust this salsa recipe in 2 different ways.  The first is fresh & crisp with a strong cilantro and garlic flavor. Fair warning, nobody will want to stand too close to you after you eat this one.  The second is a smoky chipotle with a bit of heat on the back end.  Both have become favorites in our home with different people preferring different salsas, so we either make both or agree to make the other next time.

## Ingredients
### Base Salsa
- 1 28oz can whole peeled tomatoes
- 2 cans Rotel
- ½ white onion, chopped
- ½ cup fresh cilantro leaves
- 1 clove garlic
- ½ tsp ground cumin
- Salt to taste
- Sugar to taste
- Juice of 1/2 lime

### Fresh & Crisp Additions
- 2-3 cloves garlic
- ½ cup fresh cilantro leaves
- 1 jalapeno, sliced
- Juice of ½ lime

### Smoky Chipotle Additions
- 2 chipotle peppers in adobo, or 3 if you want more heat (do not use the whole can)
- Chili powder to taste

## Instructions
1. Drain juice from tomatoes and Rotel.  Add to deep container (I use a pitcher).
1. Add other base ingredients.
1. This is a good basic salsa right now, but you can add additions you want to make a particular style.
1. Mix to desired consistency using a stick blender on low.
1. Place into refrigerator for 2 hours to allow flavors to incorporate.
1. Serve with tortilla chips.
