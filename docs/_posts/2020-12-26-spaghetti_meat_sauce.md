Sure, you can just get a jar of spaghetti sauce at the store, but I promise this is better.  Of course it is a bit more work, but I hope you'll agree that it is worth it.  We certainly enjoy this occasionally.


## Ingredients
- 1 to 1 1/2 lb lean ground beef
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large white onion, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 2 tablespoons butter or margarine
- 4 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 can diced tomatoes, undrained
- 1 can tomato sauce
- 1 small can tomato paste
- 1/4 cup ketchup
- 2 teaspoons oregano
- 1 teaspoon basil
- 1 teaspoon rosemary
- 1 tablespoon parsley
- 1 pinch sugar
- 1 pinch rubbed sage
- 3 basil leaves
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 teaspoon fresh cracked black pepper
- 1 package thin spaghetti noodles
- Fresh shredded parmesan cheese to taste
- Crushed red pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Saute onion, bell pepper, and garlic with butter until onion just starts to turn clear. Remove vegetables from heat and set aside.
1. Brown ground beef with 1 tablespoon olive oil (olive oil optional depending on how lean the ground beef is, the leaner it is the more you'll want the oil). Be sure to carefully break up the ground beef as it browns to avoid large chunks. Drain oil or grease from the ground beef.
1. Reduce heat to medium-low and return ground beef to the skillet along with the vegetables. Add diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, ketchup, and tomato paste. Mix well and wait for a few minutes until the mixture begins to bubble.
1. Add oregano, basil, rosemary, sugar, rubbed sage, parsley, bay leaves, salt, and cracked black pepper.  Mix well, reduce heat, and simmer covered for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Longer is better. Stir occasionally to avoid any scorching.
1. Add salt and 2 tablespoons olive oil to large pot of water and bring to a boil. Add thin spaghetti noodles to water and cook to desired softness. Drain noodles and place portions on plates or pasta bowls.
1. Remove bay leaves from the sauce. Spoon sauce over noodles.
1. Top with fresh grated parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper to taste and serve.
