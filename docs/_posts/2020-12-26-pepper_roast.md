It took me years to discover how to make a good pot roast.  Turns out I was trying too hard.  This simple recipe has become our favorite roast and it takes almost no effort...just patience.  

## Ingredients
- 3 lb chuck roast (or close to that size)
- 1 package onion soup mix
- 1 package ranch dip mix
- 12 oz jar sliced pepperoncini
- 1 stick of butter
- white rice

## Instructions
1. Place the chuck roast into your crock pot.
1. Evenly pour the onion soup mix and ranch dip mix over the roast.
1. Dump in the jar of pepperoncini, juice and all.
1. Set the stick of butter on top.
1. Cook in the crock pot on low for 6 hours.  You can also go longer...I usually do 8 - 10 hours.
1. You'll know it's done when it falls apart on your fork.  Serve over fresh white rice.
