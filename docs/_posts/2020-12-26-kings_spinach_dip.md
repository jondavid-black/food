If you like spinach dip, you’ll love this. It’s an interesting twist on traditional spinach dishes and makes a great all-day snack. April introduced me to this recipe which she got from the O’Keefe family cookbook, Cooking on the Coast. It’s become a staple munchie for days like Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Super Bowl Sunday when we usually spend all day cooking dinner and ignore lunch. You’ll need a pretty good sized party platter to pull this one off. The Leek soup can be hard to find in the grocery stores, so keep an eye out for it every time you go by the soups.  This serves 4 to 6 people as an appetizer.


## Ingredients
- 1 package Knorr Leek soup mix
- 1 package frozen, chopped spinach (thawed and drained, not cooked)
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1 cup sour cream
- Dash of Worcestershire sauce
- 1 (8 oz) can chopped water chestnuts
- 1 loaf King’s Hawaiian sweet bread

## Instructions
1. Mix together all ingredients except the bread to create the dip.
1. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.
1. Place bread onto a serving platter leaving some room around it.
1. Carve a bowl in the middle of the King’s Hawaiian sweet bread.
1. Pour dip into the hollowed out bowl in the loaf.
1. Tear or cut the removed bread into bite sized pieces and place in space around the loaf on the serving platter.
1. Dunk the pieces of bread into the dip and enjoy!
