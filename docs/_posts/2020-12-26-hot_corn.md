This is a recipe my mom came across during her adventures as a travelling nurse, and it has become a favorite for our family gatherings.  As you have probably noticed, we like a little spicy kick and this will definitely give you that depending on how many jalapenos you add.  I'm sure it would still be a good corn dish even without the jalapenos, but I can't imagine we'd ever try it that way.  If you do, let me know how it turns out!

## Ingredients
- 1 cup butter
- 2 8oz pkgs cream cheese
- 1/2 cup milk
- 4 15oz cans whole kernel corn, drained
- 1 12oz  jar jalapeno peppers, drained
- 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, grated
- 1 box chicken in a biscuit crackers, crushed

## Instructions
1. Preheat over to 325 deg.
1. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine butter, cream cheese, and milk.  Stir until smooth.
1. Spray a 9x13 pan with cooking spray.
1. Place crushed crackers evenly in the dish.  Place the corn in a layer over the crackers.  The place a layer of jalapenos to taste.
1. Pour cream cheese mixture over the layers.
1. Sprinkle cheddar cheese over the top.
1. Bake in the over for 35 minutes or until cheese is golden brown.
