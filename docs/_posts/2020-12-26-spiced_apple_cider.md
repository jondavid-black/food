This is a holiday favorite, especially for Connor and Spencer.  It’s really easy to make and have the whole house smelling great.  Usually we make it on the stove, but if we’re a little pressed for space in the kitchen I’ll use a crock pot and it turns out just a good.


## Ingredients
- 1 gallon apple juice
- 4 cinnamon sticks
- 3 medium oranges
- Whole cloves

## Instructions
1. Pour the apple juice into a large pot.
1. Using some pretty good force, roll the oranges on the counter to release some juice and aromatics.
1. Using a small knife, poke small slits all around the orange, spaced about ½ to 1 inch apart (closer will be spicier cider).
1. Poke a clove into each slit.
1. Drop the “cloved orange” into the apple juice.
1. Add cinnamon sticks.
1. Simmer for 1 hour, then serve warm.
