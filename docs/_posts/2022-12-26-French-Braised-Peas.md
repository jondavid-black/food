A couple weeks before Christmas I came across a video from Andy Cooks on YouTube sharing some holiday recipes. All of them looked good but the peas really caught my attention.  We tried it, with a few adjustments, and discovered a new instant classic in the Black household.  Thanks to chef Andy Hearnden for sharing [the original recipe](https://youtu.be/FSveJitkzxU). We don't have the lettuce Andy uses so we substitute with leeks. We also skip the mint from the original recipe. The result is a luxurious savory side dish that everyone raves about.

## Ingredients
- 1 bag frozen peas
- 1 stick butter
- 5 slices of thick cut hickory smoked bacon
- 3-4 leeks
- 3-4 green onions 
- 1 cup chicken broth
- salt to taste

## Instructions
1. Set out the peas to thaw about an hour before you plan to begin cooking.
1. Wash and thinly slice the leek stalks, discarding the leafy bits from right where they branch off from the stalk.  Be sure to clean them well as some grit may be present where the leaves branch out. Set them to the side.
1. Wash and slice the green onion.  Set them to the side.
1. Slice the bacon into thin strips and place into a skillet on medium heat.
1. Cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until it just starts to become crisp.
1. Add half the butter, the peas, leeks, and onion.  Stir well.
1. Add the chicken broth. Stir well.
1. Cook until the broth has reduced into a glaze, stirring regularly.
1. Add the remaining butter, cut into slices.  Stir until incorporated into the glaze.
1. Plate up and salt to taste.
