We've only recently started making this recipe. This is a quick and easy recipe, and the boys finally transitioned into stroganoff lovers, so it has become a regular in our house.  Of course there are lots of opportunities to get fancy by either using thin sliced steak, slow cooked roast, or making a "proper" cream sauce, but we enjoy this easy version just as much.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!  

## Ingredients
- 1 lb lean ground beef
- 1-2 pats of butter
- 1 large onion, sliced thin
- 1/2 package mushrooms, capped, washed, and sliced thin (discard stems)
- 1 can cream of mushroom
- 1 (8 oz) tub sour cream
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 pkg wide egg noodles
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Mix cream of mushroom and sour cream in a bowl.  Set aside.
1. Brown the ground beef and drain any grease.  Set aside.
1. Saute the onion with a pat of butter until just soft.  Add the mushrooms and cook an additional 3 to 5 minutes.
1. Add ground beef back to the pan and combine.
1. Add cream mixture and  Worcestershire.  Mix well, and simmer on low heat.
1. Fill a large pot 3/4 full with water and add a bit of salt.  Bring to a boil.  Add egg noodles and cook until soft.  Drain and return to pot.
1. Pour sauce over noodles and mix well.  Serve in bowls.
