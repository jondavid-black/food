If you’re planning to fire up the smoker, this dry rub is just what you’re looking for.  It’s great on a pork shoulder, a rack of ribs, or even a brisket.  April says it smells like Texas BBQ, which I’ll take as a compliment.  I recommend you start any good piece of pork or brisket with this dry rub on the smoker and use the Wheat Street Mop from this recipe collection to keep things nice and juicy.  Honestly, I don’t recall where I discovered this recipe (internet I’m sure), but I know it isn’t from my usual go to sources like Alton Brown or Emeril Lagasse.  So, to the mystery internet source, thank you!
