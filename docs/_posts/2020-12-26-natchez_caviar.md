This is one of our favorites from the O’Keefe family’s Cooking on the Coast cook book.  At first I thought is was crazy to see people eating black-eyed peas with tortilla chips, but then I tried it and was hooked.  This is a really great break from the normal boring snacks and appetizers.  Don’t be afraid to try it for yourself…like I was.  The O’Keefe’s say you can replace a portion of the jalapeno peppers with Greek salad peppers if you want to dial back the heat.

## Ingredients
- 3 (16 oz) cans Trappey’s jalapeno black-eyed peas, drained
- 1 (8 oz) bottle Italian dressing
- 1 ½ cups onions, chopped fine
- 1 cup green onions, chopped
- ½ cup jalapeno peppers, chopped
- 1 (4 oz) jar pimento, chopped and drained
- Tortilla chips

## Instructions
1. Mix all ingredients (except tortilla chips) in a large mixing bowl.  Place in a large zip lock bag.
1. Let stand in refrigerator for 8 hours prior to serving.  Turn occasionally to marinate.
1. Serve as a dip with tortilla chips.
