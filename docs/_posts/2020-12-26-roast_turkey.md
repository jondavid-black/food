This is a recipe I adapted from Alton Brown, my favorite celebrity chef.  We really like the flavor added by the Cajun injector, but you can leave that out if you want a more traditional turkey dinner.  We've been doing this for years and it always turns out great.  Of course this is our go to recipe for when family gets together over Thanksgiving.  Pair this with Holiday Dressing from this recipe collection and a homemade gravy using the turkey drippings for a feast that will make you the designated cook for years to come.

## Ingredients
- 1 (14-16 lb) turkey
- 1 jar Cajun butter injector
- Canola oil
- 2 cups chicken broth

### Brine
- 1 cup kosher salt
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 1 gallon vegetable stock
- 1 Tbsp black peppercorns
- 1 1/2 tsp allspice berries
- 1 1/2 tsp chopped candied ginger
- 1 gallon heavily iced water

### Aromatics
- 1 red apple, sliced
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 cup water
- 4 sprigs rosemary
- 6 leaves sage

## Instructions
1. Combine all brine ingredients except iced water in a large pot.  Boil, stirring occasionally until salt sugar and ginger are dissolved.  Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.
1. Place turkey (neck and giblets removed) in a 5 gallon bucket (or cooler).  Pour brine over turkey.  Cover fully with iced water.  Let sit overnight, turning once.
1. Remove turkey from brine, rinse well, and pat dry.  Inject Cajun butter into all the major portions of the turkey, being careful to distribute evenly.
1. Combine apple, onion, cinnamon stick, and water in a small pot.  Steep until softened and insert into turkey cavity along with other aromatics.
1. Place turkey on a rack in a roasting dish.  Pour chicken broth into the pan.
1. Coat turkey skin with canola oil and roast at 500 degrees for 30 minutes.  Reduce heat to 350 degrees and roast, basting occasionally, until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.
1. Let turkey rest for 15 minutes before carving.
