For decades when I wanted a quick cajun bite I'd reach for the box of Zatarain's Jambalaya.
Over time I realized it wasn't much more than a vessel to hold the flavor of sausage and Louisiana hot sauce.
I got burned out on it and was ready for a change, so I went searching for a recipe.
I came across an online recipe from Joy the Baker that was almost aligned with what I was looking for.
The below recipe borrows heavily from Joy but pushes things up a notch.

## Ingredients
- Smoked Chicken
    - 1 whole chicken
    - 1 jar Cajun butter injector
    - Rub (Weber N'Orleans Cajun) 
- 1 lb Conecuh hot sausage
- 1/2 stick of butter
- 2 white or yellow onions, diced
- 2 green bell peppers, diced
- 5 celery stalks, sliced thin (not too thin)
- 1 Tbsp paprika
- 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (or to taste)
- 2 Tbsp Louisiana hot sauce
- 1/2 package fresh thyme
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 cups white rice
- 4 cups chicken stock
- 4-6 green onions, sliced for garnish


## Instructions
1. Smoke the chicken
    1. Wash and quarter the chicken
    1. Liberally inject the chicken with the cajun injector
    1. Liberally spread the rub on all surfaces of the chicken quarters
    1. Smoke at 275 degrees for about 2.5 hours or until you hit 165 degrees on your instant read thermometer.
    1. Remove from the smoker and let rest.
1. Grill the sausage until you have a nice char on the surface.
1. In a oven safe dutch oven, melt the butter.
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
1. Add onion, green pepper, and celery.  Cook till heated through but not soft.
1. Add thyme, garlic, paprika, cayenne, oregano, bay leaves, and hot sauce.  Stir to combine and cook for 2-3 min.
1. Slice and add sausage.  Cook for another 2 minutes.
1. Add rice and stir to combine well.  Cook another 2 minutes.
1. Add chicken stock.
1. Add chicken quarters on top and try to submerge.
1. Wait for chicken stock to begin simmering, stirring occasionally to avoid scorching the Jambalaya at the bottom of the pot.
1. Put on the lid, place in the oven, and cook for 30 min.
1. Remove the chicken quarters.  Stir the Jambalaya, replace the lid, and let rest off any heat.
1. Pull the chicken into bite size portions, removing all skin and bones.
1. Add the pulled chicken back to the Jambalaya and combine well.
1. Slice the green onions.
1. Serve the Jambalaya in a bowl with green onion as a top garnish.  Offer Louisiana hot sause for additional heat and flavor.
