This is one of April's favorite recipes.  She makes it almost every time we have people over to the house and it usually doesn't last very long.  I almost put this into the appetizer section, but it is so sweet I thought it fit better in the dessert section.  Be aware that the Heath toffee bits are a bit hard to find at the grocery store, so Publix people like us (closest to our house) usually make a special trip to Kroger to find them.  Everyone with a sweet tooth will love this dip.

## Ingredients
- 1 (8 oz) pkg cream cheese
- 1 cup white sugar
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 bag Heath toffee bits with chocolate
- Apple wedges (Granny Smith are our favorite)

## Instructions
1. Let cream cheese warm to room temperature.
1. Mix cream cheese, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, and Heath toffee bits in a medium bowl.
1. Let chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
1. Serve dip with apple slices.
