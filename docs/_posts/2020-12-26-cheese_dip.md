This cheese dip always manages to please a crowd.  I think this is the first time I've actually written down a recipe for it.  I've realized that I probably do it a little different each time and I've never really measured anything before.  Feel free to adjust things to your own taste.  I like it with a little kick so I add sliced jalapenos and some jalapeno juice.  I have experimented with other cheeses and found that nothing melts like Velveeta, but don't hesitate to experiment yourself and let me know how it turns out.

## Ingredients
- 1 box Velveeta
- 1 medium onion
- 1 green bell pepper
- 1-2 pats butter
- 1 lb Jimmy Dean sausage (regular or hot to taste)
- 2 cans Rotel (original)
- 1/2 tsp chili powder (to taste)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin (to taste)
- 1/4 cub sliced jalapenos from a jar with a little juice (optional)
- Tortilla chips

## Instructions
1. Cut the Velveeta into cubes and place in a pot or crock pot.
1. Brown the sausage and drain.
1. Chop and saute the onion and bell pepper with a pat of butter.
1. Stir sausage, vegetables, Rotel, chili powder, cumin, and jalapenos into the Velveeta cubes.
1. Apply low to medium heat stirring every few minutes until Velveeta is fully melted.  Be careful not to scorch the Velveeta.
1. Serve with tortilla chips.
