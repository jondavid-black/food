April originally came across this basic recipe a few years ago.  It started out as Pesto Pita Pizza which youâ€™ll recognize if you have the older version of my cook book.  The only difference is using pita bread as the crust instead of Nan.  As the boys got bigger, and ate more and more, we were making multiple pita pizzas for them.  During this time I discovered the magic that is Halal Kababs and the Nan bread that comes with them.  When I saw Nan in the grocery store, it was an obvious next step.  I hope you enjoy it as much as us!


## Ingredients
- 4 pieces Nan, regular or garlic
- 1 (8 oz) box cream cheese
- 2 to 3 Tbsp pesto, to taste
- Your favorite pizza toppings
- 4 cups shredded mozzarella
- Shredded parmesan cheese
- Chopped (or dried) parsley
- Crushed red pepper, to taste


## Instructions
1. Combine cream cheese and pesto in a bowl and stir well.
1. Spread the mixture onto one side of your Nan.
1. Add desired toppings.
1. Top each with mozzarella cheese.
1. Sprinkle parmesan cheese and parsley over each pizza.
1. Place on cookie sheets and bake at 350 until cheese is melted.
1. Allow to cool for 3 to 5 minutes, sprinkle with crushed red pepper (if desired), slice (if desired), and serve.
