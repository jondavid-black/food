We all fell in love with lobster bisque while visiting Mom in Connecticut for Thanksgiving in 2015.  We haven’t found anything like it here in the south, so when I found lobster tails on sale at the grocery, we had to give it a try. I did my best to follow this Bobby Flay recipe and it turned out pretty good.  Hope you enjoy it too.

## Ingredients
- 4 (1 ½ lb) lobster tails
- 1 ½ cups tomato paste
- 1 ½ cups coarsely chopped onion
- 1 ½ cups coarsely chopped celery
- 1 ½ cups coarsely chopped carrot
- 1 sprig thyme
- 3 sprigs flat-leaf parsley, plus extra for garnish
- ½ teaspoon saffron
- 6 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup cream sherry
- 2 Tbsp fresh ground black pepper
- ¼ cup cornstarch

## Instructions
1. Fill large stockpot with water and bring to a boil.  Completely immerse lobsters head first.  When water re-boils, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Do not overcook.  Remove lobsters and save the stock.
1. Place 10 cups of stock in a stockpot on low heat.  Clean meat from claws, tails.  Place shells in stock pot.  Cut bodies in quarters and place in stockpot.  Add 1 cup tomato paste and simmer on low heat for 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally, careful to not burn the stock.  Pour through a sieve into a clean pot to get about 8 cups of red stock.
1. Place onions, celery, carrots, thyme, parsley and saffron in a large sauté pan. Add 4 cups of the original stock and cook on high for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.  Add ½ cup tomato paste and black pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Hit is with a stick blender, then pour through a sieve into the previous red stock.
1. Place over medium heat.  Slowly whisk in heavy cream, then sherry.  Simmer on low heat for 20 minutes.  Mix cornstarch with ¼ cup water and slowly whisk into bisque.  Simmer for another 20 minutes.
1. Chop lobster meat.  Add lobster meat to bowl and ladle bisque over it.  Garnish with parsley.
