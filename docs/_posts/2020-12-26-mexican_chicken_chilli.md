This is a pretty interesting twist on chili. If you’re a chili purist, you may be offended by the name of this recipe, but once you try it, you’ll agree this is a really tasty dish. We found this one years ago when we bought a grocery store checkout slow cooker cook book shortly after we got a crock pot. I’ve had to tweak it a bit to conform to April’s meat requirements.  You may want to use dark meat instead, as the original recipe calls for. This serves 4 to 6 people.

## Ingredients
- 3 to 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 1 medium onion chopped
- 2 medium stalks celery, sliced
- 2 cans stewed tomatoes with garlic and onion, undrained
- 2 cans (15 oz each) pinto beans, undrained
- 1 can (10 oz) enchilada sauce
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 bag scoop-shaped corn chips (optional…but you’ll want these)
- ½ cup sour cream
- 1 cup cheddar cheese, grated
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional…but this makes the dish in my opinion)

## Instructions
1. Spray 4 to 5 quart slow cooker with cooking spray.
1. In cooker, mix all ingredients except sour cream, cilantro, and corn chips.
1. Cover and cook on low heat setting for 7 to 8 hours
1. Stir mixture to break up chicken.
1. Top each serving with corn chips, sour cream, cheddar cheese, and cilantro.
