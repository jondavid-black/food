This has become another regular at our family gatherings.  I count on this dish to compliment the savory dishes I usually prepare.  Fair warning...this is sweet, possibly considered a vegetable dish but is dangerously close to being dessert. That said, it really goes well with a Thanksgiving feast.  Everyone is always happy to see this one coming out of the oven as the turkey is resting.

## Ingredients

- Sweet Potatoes
    - 3 cups mashed sweet potatoes
    - 3/4 stick butter, melted
    - 1 cup evaporated milk
    - 1 1/2 cup white sugar
    - 2 eggs
    - 1/2 tsp cinnamon
    - 1 tsp vanilla
-  Topping
    - 1 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
    - 1 cup brown sugar
    - 3/4 stick butter, melted

## Instructions
1. Mix all the sweet potato ingredients together. Place in casserole dish and bake at 425 degrees for 15 minutes or until heated through.
1. Mix all the topping ingredients together.  After the sweet potatoes are heated through, pour the topping over and bake for another 15 minutes.
1. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
