This Thanksgiving we were looking for a good savory dish to take to Friends-giving.
We'd never made dirty rice before, so we decided to give it a go.
And my goodness did it turn out nicely.
Needless to say we didn't have any leftovers to pack home with us.
I hope you find this as tasty as we did.

## Ingredients
- 2 cups long grain white rice
- 4 cups chicken broth (to cook the rice)
- 1 bunch of fresh parsley

- 5 celery stalks, sliced (not too thin)

- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 1-2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper
- 1-2 tsp cajun seasoning
- 1/4 cup flour
- 2 cups chicken broth


## Instructions
1. Rinse the rice and cook in a rice cooker using chicken broth (not water).
1. Cut off the top of the parsley and chop relatively finely.  Set aside.
1. Once the rice is done, let cool for a few minutes and then fold in the parsley.  Set aside.
