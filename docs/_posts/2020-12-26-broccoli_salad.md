This is an old standard but I really like it so I threw it in here. I actually got hooked on this stuff while working out in Colorado Springs...the office catering/cafeteria made this regularly. This is a great option if you need to bring a vegetable to a potluck. I found this particular recipe out on the internet somewhere, but unfortunately don't remember the details. This serves 4 to 6 people.

## Ingredients
- 4 cups fresh broccoli florets
- 1 small onion, halved and thinly sliced
- 8 slices crisp bacon
- 3 tablespoons vinegar
- 1 cup plumped raisins
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1/3 cup sugar

## Instructions
1. Pour boiling water over raisins to plump them.
1. Chop broccoli and onion.
1. Crumble crisply fried bacon.
1. Combine mayonnaise, vinegar, and sugar in a bowl and mix well.
1. Combine broccoli, onion, drained raisins, and bacon in a bowl.
1. Pour liquid mixture over broccoli mixture and toss until evenly coated.
1. Cover and chill in refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
