Another amazing dessert, and I’m really not a big dessert person.  We don’t do this very often, but it is always a hit when we do.  Usually someone else, like Mom (thanks!), makes it and brings it to our big family meals and it is always a hit.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.  If you are a fan of strawberries, I don’t see how you wouldn’t.

## Ingredients
- Crust
    - 1 ½ cups pretzels, crushed
    - 4 ½ Tbsp white sugar
    - ¾ cup butter, melted
- 1 cup white sugar
- 2 (8 oz) pkg cream cheese
- 1 (8 oz) pkg Cool Whip topping, thawed
- 1 (6 oz) pkg strawberry flavored Jell-O
- 2 cups boiling water
- 1 lb frozen strawberries

## Instructions
1. Mix crust ingredients in a bowl.  Press into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking pan.  Cook in 350 degree oven for 10 minutes or until lightly toasted.  Set aside to cool completely.
1. In a medium bowl, beat the sugar and cream cheese until smooth.  Fold in Cool Whip.  Spread evenly over the cooled crust.  Refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.
1. In a medium bowl, stir together the Jell-O mix and boiling water.  Mix in frozen strawberries and stir until thawed.  Pour over cream cheese mixture in pan.  Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 1 hour.
