This is easily one of my favorite chicken dishes.  It is actually the first thing I ever cooked for April when we were dating (before I realized she was a bit picky about her meat selections).  I think this may be one of the first recipes my Mom taught me to cook.  Honestly, it is just an adaptation of chicken and rice, but who doesn't love chicken and rice?  If you really want to crank up the flavor, double the bacon!

## Ingredients
- 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 4 strips of bacon
- 1 can dried beef
- 1 (8 oz) container sour cream
- 1 can cream of mushroom soup
- White rice, for serving

## Instructions
1. Mix sour cream and cream of mushroom soup in a bowl.
1. Line a casserole dish (bottom and sides) with dried beef.
1. Individually wrap each chicken breast with a slice of bacon.
1. Place chicken breasts evenly spaced in casserole dish over the dried beef.
1. Pour sour cream and soup mixture into the casserole dish covering the chicken breasts.
1. Cover and bake in oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes to an hour.
1. Remove cover and brown the top.
1. Remove from oven and allow to cool a little before serving with rice.
