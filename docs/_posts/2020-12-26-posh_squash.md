This is one of April’s favorite dishes, going back to her childhood.  I’m not a fan of squash, but even I have to admit it is good.  If you like squash, this recipe is for you!  Thanks to GG (Great Grandma) Sue for sharing this recipe with us!

## Ingredients
- 2 lbs yellow squash, sliced
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1 cup parmesan cheese, grated
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 2 eggs, beaten
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- ½ cup soft bread crumbs
- 1 Tbsp butter, melted

## Instructions
1. Cook squash in just enough boiling water to cover for 10-15 minutes or until tender.  Drain and set aside to cool slightly.
1. Combine mayonnaise, cheese, onions, eggs, salt, and pepper.  Stir until well mixed.
1. Gently fold squash into the mixture.
1. Pour into a lightly greased 1 ½ quart casserole dish.
1. Combine bread crumbs and butter.  Spoon over the squash mixture.
