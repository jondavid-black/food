Never subject your family and friends to that red can shaped sorry excuse for a cranberry side dish again.  Real, fresh cranberry relish is where it's at!  I'm pretty sure I found this on a bag of cranberries one year and we've never looked back.  Other than the turkey and dressing recipes from this collection, this is the one thing that Spencer says is absolutely mandatory every Thanksgiving.  One you try it, you will make it mandatory as well.  Enjoy!

## Ingredients
- 1 bag (12 oz) fresh cranberries (from the produce section)
- 1 large orange
- 1 cup sugar

## Instructions
1. Wash and sort the cranberries.  Remove any "bad ones" or junk that slipped through the packaging.
1. Cut a bit of zest from the orange and set aside.  Then peel the orange and cut into quarters.
1. Place cranberries, orange quarters, and zest into a food processor.  Pulse until all the contents are finely chopped an well blended.  You may need to open and stir a bit if things clump onto the sides.  Do no liquify, you want it a little chunky.
1. Pour from the food processor into a bowl.  Add sugar.  Mix well.  Cover and let set in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes.
