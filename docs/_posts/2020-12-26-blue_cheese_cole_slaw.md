We got this recipe from some of our friends when we lived in Colorado Springs. It's a really nice and flavorful alternative slaw when having a barbecue. This goes great with pulled pork, ribs, or smoked pork tenderloin. Unfortunately this dish doesn't have a long shelf life so don't plan on more than a day of leftovers. This is enough to serve 6 people.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup blue cheese, crumbled
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 12 cups shredded green cabbage (about 1 large head)
- Fresh ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Put blue cheese, buttermilk, apple cider vinegar, and sugar in food processor or blender.
1. Blend until smooth.
1. Add fresh ground black pepper to taste.
1. Pour mixture over shredded cabbage.
1. Stir until evenly covered.
1. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.
1. Toss before serving.
