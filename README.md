## Contributing
Do you have a recipe you'd like to contribute?  Please do!
1. Clone the repository.
1. Create a branch.
1. Add your recipe in markdown to the /docs/_posts directory.  It may be easiest to copy one of the existing and modify it as a template.
1. Commit and push your change.
1. Create a pull request.  Make sure the continuous integration build passes.  You may have to add an unrecognized word to the dictionary in /src/dict.txt if you're getting incorrect spelling errors.
